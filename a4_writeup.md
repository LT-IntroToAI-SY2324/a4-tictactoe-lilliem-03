# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
I think that has_won was the most difficult part for e because I was unsure how to explain someone had won I didn't think about using the numbers of the placments of the "x" and "O" to show ways to win the game. 
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would add a computer player by bulding a function that removes the numbers that a human player would put, for example if a human player were to put their move at three the code would take out that optin ofr the computer, I would also have a function that tracks when the human player would be close to winning to help the computer block  the player from winning and further improving the computers chance of winning.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
I would have the computer recognize the player about to win and then put a mark down to block the player from winning everytime and if the player wasnt about the win the computer would keep track of thier placings to make sure that they were going to win as well.
